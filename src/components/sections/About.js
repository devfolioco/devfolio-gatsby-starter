      <p>
        The Sith killed each other, victims of their own greed. But from the
        ashes of their destruction, I was the last survivor. I chose to pass my
        knowledge on to only one. I created a legacy so resilient that now you
        come before me.

        An object cannot make you good or evil. The temptation of power,
        forbidden knowledge, even the desire to do good can lead some down that
        path. But only you can change yourself.
